# Liberty Project Miner

Welcome to **Liberty Project Miner**! This repository contains the Liberty Project network CPU miner. The network coin is **LBRT** and this miner allows members to contribute to the network by mining blocks and receiving rewards.

Note: the external miner finds solutions and reports them to the node. if the node accepts the solution, the reward is credited to the node's coinbase.
