# Liberty Project Miner

Welcome to **Liberty Project Miner**! This repository contains the Liberty Project network CPU miner. The network coin is **LBRT** and this miner allows members to contribute to the network by mining blocks and receiving rewards.

Note: the external miner finds solutions and reports them to the node. if the node accepts the solution, the reward is credited to the node's coinbase.

## How to Start Mining

### Basic Command

```bash
./miner <url-rpc> <number-of-threads>
```

### Example

```bash
./liberty-linux-amd64 https://rpc.libertyproject.space 12

```

### Parameters

- **`<url-rpc>`**: The RPC URL of the node you want to connect to.
- **`<number-of-threads>`**: The number of CPU threads to use for mining.
Note: it is important for a miner to use its own rpc configured by [Liberty Project chain](https://github.com/LibertyProject-chain/LibertyProject-chain)
